Changelog:

v1.0.0 - 22/09/2016
Has been a while, hasn't it? Anyhow, these are things:
- Removed audio options, as I felt that they were unnecessary and inconvenient.
- Automatically activate detection when it's run from a USB device.
- Silent mode now runs with the /silent argument
- Settings file is now redundant

v0.1.0 - 25/06/2015
- Check whether an USB device is still present at shutdown.
- Play a sound when that is the case.
- Show a message.
- Run silently on boot, monitoring new USB devices and adding them to the watch list.
